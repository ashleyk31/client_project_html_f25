        <h2>Why Networking Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Networking is one of the most powerful ways to learn about career opportunities, 
          gain advice from experienced professionals, and build connections that can lead to 
          internships or jobs. At UMSI, you have access to alumni, peers, faculty, and industry 
          experts who are eager to share their insights. By starting early and practicing your 
          networking skills, you’ll feel more confident approaching new opportunities.

        <h2>Tips for Successful Networking</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Reach out to classmates, faculty, or alumni from student groups before connecting with new contacts.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Curious:</strong> Ask thoughtful questions about someone’s career path, role, or organization rather than focusing only on job openings.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow Up:</strong> Always send a thank-you message after a conversation to express appreciation and keep the connection alive.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Your Pitch:</strong> A short “elevator pitch” about your interests and skills will help people remember you.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Organized:</strong> Track your contacts, conversations, and next steps in a document or spreadsheet.</li>
        </ul>
