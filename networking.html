        <h2>Tips for Successful Networking</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Reach out to classmates, faculty, or alumni from student groups before connecting with new contacts.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Curious:</strong> Ask thoughtful questions about someone’s career path, role, or organization rather than focusing only on job openings.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow Up:</strong> Always send a thank-you message after a conversation to express appreciation and keep the connection alive.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Your Pitch:</strong> A short “elevator pitch” about your interests and skills will help people remember you.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Organized:</strong> Track your contacts, conversations, and next steps in a document or spreadsheet.</li>
        </ul>
